 VERSION 1.9
==============

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------
* It is possible to use the operator * in the Markov chain design option (e.g. task=5*T,10*R,5*S:0)
* New option in MOLECULE DATABASE "store", allows to centralize the geometry files. M3C.makeDB has been updated accordingly.
* New option in GOPTIONS block. radiusType = COVALENT | VAN_DER_WAALS. Radii of fragments are calculated using the type selected.
  In the previous version it was  only used covalent radius (default=COVALENT). To study floppy systems like argon clusters it is a crucial enhancement.
  Summary of available atoms:
     COVALENT ==> H-Ar
     VAN_DER_WAALS ==> H,Li,Na,K,Rb,Cs, Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Ba, Sc,Y,La, Ti,Zr,Hf, V,Nb,Ta, Cr,Mo,W, He,Ne,Ar,Kr,Xe
* Following commands now include the possibility to use several SMP processors per task:
    M3C-gamess.freqs, M3C-gamess.geniso, M3C-gamess.iener, M3C-gamess.optg
    M3C-gaussian.freqs, M3C-gaussian.geniso, M3C-gaussian.iener, M3C-gaussian.optg
* The option gammaLCorrection is not supported anymore.

Fixes
-----
* The M3C-* commands now have a brief usage message when they are executed with an incomplete number of parameters.
* Backup directories now include generating date.
* MOLPRO support will be deprecated in next version.

 VERSION 1.8
==============

Improvements and New Features
-----------------------------
* Sampling of rotational energy is now included.
* Comparison of molecules in M3C-gamess.geniso and M3C-gaussian.geniso has been improved.
* M3C-gaussian.iener in now available.
* Reaction plots are now available through M3C.analysis tool (depend on graphviz www.graphviz.org). Options "reactions" and "reactionsd".

Fixes
-----
* Fixes to make M3C-gaussian.optg compatible with M3C-gamess.optg.
* Fixed a bug in format for large names of fragmentation channels in M3C.makeDB.
