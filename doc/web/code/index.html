	The M<sub>3</sub>C
	(Microcanonical Metropolis Monte-Carlo) is a software package designed
	in the field of Computational Chemistry that allows to study the
	fragmentation of molecules by providing structural quantities from
	standard electronic-structure methods. Typically the simplest systems
	require quantities such as geometries, electronic energies, wave
	function symmetry, lowest dissociation limits and harmonic frequencies
	for each molecule to be considered. It is however possible to include
	analytical intermolecular potential energy curves in order to describe
	weakly bounded systems or special effects like Coulomb repulsion in
	fragmentation of multiply charged molecules.<br>
	<br>
	The theoretical description behind this implementation is a specific
	random way to move in the phase space until a region of maximum
	entropy is reached, where the physical observables are measured by
	performing a statistical average in this region. This method was&nbsp;
	successfully applied to study of thermodynamics in nuclear physics
	[1],&nbsp; fragmentation of hot metal clusters [2] and fragmentation
	of neutral carbon clusters [3]. In this work, the theoretical
	description was revised, being now based on a rigorous expression of
	the classical density of states for a rotating system ( see for
	example [4] ). Furthermore in the current version we are able to
	calculate channels/species distributions, branching ratios, energy
	components distributions, temperature, heat capacity and entropy as a
	function of the excitation energy.
